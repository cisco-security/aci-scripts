ASA Device Package with PBR Service Graph and One-Arm L4-L7 Devicehttps://github.com/cisco-security/aci-scripts/tree/master/pod2-asa-pbr-graphThe python scripts included in the GitHub build a Tenant pod2 and insert a PBR service graph, using one-arm model in communication path between EPGs inside the same Bridge Domain.  ASA5525-X model in multi-context mode is used and one of the contexts is allocated to this service graph.  The user context is registered and used with a managed (service policy model).The rebuild-mypod.bash script is a wrapper around all the python scripts that in proper order orchestrate this tenant and service graph.  Each python script will print the XML sent to APIC.The python scripts depend on underlying pre-configured settings to execute properly.  Those would have to be updated to match the new APIC env you plan to deploy this in.  Such items include names of: VVM and physical domains, imported ASA device package, pre-configured vPC (if used for ASA data plane), etc.  ASAv appliance can be used in this case as well, which would eliminate the need for a physical domain currently used under device registration.Please refer this YouTube link for an instructional video and demo:ASA PBR Service Graph Demo in ACI Fabrichttps://youtu.be/eZi0ViEoWuE
